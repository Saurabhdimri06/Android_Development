In this it is shown on how to add video in an android application.
For adding the video we have to drag the video layou in Activity.xml file.
After that new folder has to be created in the res folder under the name (raw).
  Inside that raw folder the video to be added is copied and the commnads are written in the mainactivity.java file
  to finally make the video running in the app.
  
Hope this helps!!
